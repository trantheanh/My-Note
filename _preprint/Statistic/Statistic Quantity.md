# 1. Range of unit: 

Same data but with difference range (on your plot) can trick your conclusion (can turn slightly go up to shoot up):



# 2. Range of data:

Represent the spread of data from min range to max range. Data could be scale to [0, 1] when divide by range

# 3. Histogram:

Represent the frequency of data. Data range is split by bins and each bin containt number of them, histogram shows the frequency of data in the bins.

# 4. Trend:

Represent the change of data throught time 

# 5. Chart:

Represent amount of different object. Histogram is one type of chart

# 6. Average:

There is several kind of mean: 

- Geometry mean
- Harmonic Mean
- ...

# 7. Median:

Represent the center of data. Sort data and median is the item with center index.

# 8. Mode:

Represent the most frequent data.

# 9. Mean:

Containt the meaning of data. Show where the point data surround.

# 10. Variance:

Represent how spread data from the mean. (square distance)

# 11. Standard Deviation:

Same about variance but distance only.

# 12. z-Score:

The normalize form of data, with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. (The reason why they helps compair difference random variable)
